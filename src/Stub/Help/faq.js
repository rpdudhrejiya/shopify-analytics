		question: "Can I try Shopify Search before subscribing?",
		answer: "When you install Rapid Search on your store, you will be able to use it for free for 14 days even if you exceed the limits of the free plan (1,500 searches per month)."
	},
	{
		question: "What happens when my trial ends?",
		answer: "If your store does not exceed the 1,500 searches, your plan automatically changes from trial to free. So there is no need to signup for the free plan. If your store exceeds the limits of the free plan (1,500 searches), you need to sign up for the relevant paid plan."
	},
	{
		question:"What happens if I exceed the plan’s monthly limit?",
		answer:"This is good news because that means you drive traffic well! In this case, we will send you a notification with an “upgrade reminder.” If you don’t want to upgrade, the original search engine will be restored in your store till the end of the billing period, instead of Rapid Search."
	},
	{
		question:"Will I loose my trial days if I sign-up earlier?",
		answer:"No, you can subscribe any time, you won't pay for the trial. You won't be charged till the end of your trial."
	},
	{
		question:"Do I need to pay extra for visitors?",
		answer:"No, your Rapid Search subscription is valid for unlimited visitors."
	},
	{
		question:"Do I get access to all features when I sign up to a paid plan?",
		answer:"Yes, all of our plans include all features and ROI guarantee."
	},
	{
		question:"How is search revenue calculated?",
		answer:"Search revenue is the sum of those order totals, where the visitor has used the search at least once before placing the order."
	},
	{
		question:"What does the term “search” mean?",
		answer:"A search starts from the time the visitor clicks/opens the search box. In this case, Rapid Search recommends Popular Searches. A search is completed when a visitor clicks on a suggested keyword, collection, or product suggestion, or navigates to another page. For example, if a visitor clicks the search box, types “note,” and then clicks on the proposed notebook keyword, that counts as 1 search."
